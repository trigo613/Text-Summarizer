2 The TextRank Model Graph-based ranking algorithms are essentially a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph

In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information

Hence, the score associated with a vertex is determined based on the votes that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices casting these votes

The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex

Moreover, the importance of the vertex casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is, and this information is also taken into account by the ranking model

Rank: 1, Sentence: 2 The TextRank Model Graph-based ranking algorithms are essentially a way of deciding the importance of a vertex within a graph, based on global information recursively drawn from the entire graph
Rank: 2, Sentence: In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information
Rank: 3, Sentence: Hence, the score associated with a vertex is determined based on the votes that are cast for it, and the score of the vertices casting these votes
Rank: 4, Sentence: The higher the number of votes that are cast for a vertex, the higher the importance of the vertex
Rank: 5, Sentence: Moreover, the importance of the vertex casting the vote determines how important the vote itself is, and this information is also taken into account by the ranking model

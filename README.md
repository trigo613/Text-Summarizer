# TF-IDF TextRank Summarizer

This C++ project implements a text summarization tool using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) embeddings and the TextRank algorithm. It extracts the most important sentences from a given text file based on their significance within the document.
For more details, refer to the [original paper](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf).


## Process

- Reads input text from a file
- Generates TF-IDF embeddings for each sentence
- Applies the TextRank algorithm to rank sentences
- Outputs the top N most important sentences to a file

## Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/trigo613/Text-Summarizer.git
   cd Text-Summarizer
   ```

2. Create a build directory and run CMake:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

## Usage

Run the executable with the following command-line arguments:

```
./Text_Summarizer <input_file_path> <output_file_path> <num_sentences>
```

Example:
```
./Text_Summarizer Text.txt TextSummary.txt 5
```

- `<input_file_path>`: Path to the input text file
- `<output_file_path>`: Path to the output file where summarized sentences will be written
- `<num_sentences>`: Number of top sentences to include in the summary


## Summary of Article: The Benefits of Coffee
The following sentences are a short summary, generated by our algorithm, highlighting the top five most important sentences from the article ["9 Reasons Why the Right Amount of Coffee Is Good for You".](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/9-reasons-why-the-right-amount-of-coffee-is-good-for-you) You can find the complete summary in TextSummary.txt, and the full article in Text.txt.
